Phase 1: Basic Functionality
Button and Streak System:

Create a button that tracks daily presses.
Store the streak in localStorage so it persists across sessions.
Reset the streak if the button isn’t pressed for a day.
(Done): Basic index.html and JavaScript logic is already implemented.
Discord Webhook:

Send a message (“An user pressed the button”) to a Discord webhook each time the button is pressed.
(Done): Webhook logic has been discussed.
Phase 2: User-Friendly Features
Sign-Up and Login System:

Add a sign-up form where users enter a unique code (15–20 characters, 2 special characters, 1 number).
Implement a login system that uses the same code to identify returning users.
Store user data (e.g., streak count, last press date) in localStorage.
Cookies for Auto-Login:

Use cookies to remember the user, so they don’t need to log in every time they visit.
Phase 3: Visual Enhancements
Improve UI/UX:

Center-align everything with a clean design.
Add a motivational message that changes each time the button is pressed (e.g., “Great job! Keep going!”).
Use simple animations for button clicks (e.g., a bounce or glow effect).
Add a background color or gradient that changes dynamically based on the streak (e.g., the longer the streak, the brighter the gradient).
Mobile Responsiveness:

Make sure the page works well on all devices by improving the layout for small screens.
Phase 4: Streak Celebrations
Milestone Rewards:

Show special effects (like confetti or a popup) when users reach milestones like 7, 30, or 100 days.
Sound Effects:

Add sound effects when the button is pressed for a fun and interactive experience.
Daily Rewards/Challenges:

Add rotating daily motivational quotes or mini-goals to keep users engaged.
Phase 5: Advanced Features
Dark Mode:

Add a toggle for light mode and dark mode.
Save Streaks Online:

Use a simple backend (e.g., Firebase or Supabase) to save streaks so they’re accessible from multiple devices.
Progress Bar:

Add a progress bar that fills up as users approach the next milestone.
Phase 6: Optional Fun Features
Confetti Animation:

Use a library like Canvas Confetti to create fun animations when the button is pressed.
Custom Themes:

Let users choose a theme (e.g., “space,” “nature”) for the background and button style.
Installable App (PWA):

Turn the website into a Progressive Web App (PWA) so users can install it on their device like an app.
